## Big O Notation

Understanding Big O notation is crucial for analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms. This repository includes in-depth explanations and illustrative examples of Big O notation, helping you grasp the concept and its implications in algorithm design and optimization.

## Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures that store a collection of elements in contiguous memory locations. This repository covers various array operations, such as traversal, insertion, deletion, and searching, along with their time complexities. It also explores advanced techniques like dynamic arrays and array manipulation algorithms.

### Linked Lists

Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. This repository implements singly linked lists and provides examples of common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. It also covers advanced topics like circular linked lists and linked list variants.

### Doubly Linked Lists

Doubly linked lists are a variant of linked lists where each node contains pointers to both the next and previous nodes. This repository covers the implementation and operations of doubly linked lists, as well as their advantages and use cases.

### Stacks and Queues

Stacks and queues are linear data structures with specific insertion and deletion rules. This repository includes implementations of stacks (LIFO) and queues (FIFO), along with their common operations and real-world applications. It also explores advanced topics like deques (double-ended queues) and priority queues.

### Binary Trees

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures where each node can have at most two children. This repository covers the implementation of binary trees, along with various traversal techniques (e.g., pre-order, in-order, post-order) and common operations like insertion, deletion
